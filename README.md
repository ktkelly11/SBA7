# React API Application

## The Approach

The approach I take when working with APIs is to find one that works first and foremost. There are so many out there that contain loads of great information, but don't neccesarily work for what you want to do. Once I found the European art API, and it had a secure API key and could make HTTP requests, I knew I had to use it as it had references to so many great paintings and artists. I then chose to make a gallery of a number of paintings of a great artist, Renoir. The impressionists did some truly stunning work!

## Tech

I used a number of open source projects in order to make my application work properly:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

- I also used the Europeana Pro API (https://pro.europeana.eu/discover-the-data/apis#general), an amazing source of artwork across Europe

This is in a public repository on GitHub.

## Unsolved Problems

A problem that I would love to return to is my search bar feature. I was unable to make it work, but would love to be able to use the search capabilities of the API to find works by other artists.
