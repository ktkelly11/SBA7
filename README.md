# React API Application

## The Idea

I wanted to use a different API to create a gallery or search for artwork.

## Tech

I used a number of open source projects in order to make my application work properly:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

- I also used the Europeana Pro API (https://pro.europeana.eu/discover-the-data/apis#general), an amazing source of artwork across Europe

This is in a public repository on GitHub.
